# Two Pointers
-  Two Pointers technique involves maintaining two pointers or references to elements in a data structure.
- These pointers are used to traverse or process data efficiently.
- Offenly associated with arrays, linked lists, and strings.

## Common Problems
### 1. Searching and Summation
Two Sum Problem: Given an array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target sum.
### 2. Array Manipulation
Container With Most Water: Find two lines in an array of heights that form a container with the most water.
### 3. List Manipulation
Reverse a String or List: Efficiently reverse a string, array, or linked list.
### 4. Linked List Algorithms
Linked List Cycle Detection: Detecting a cycle in a linked list can be achieved using Two Pointers (Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).
### 5. Sorting and Merging
Merge Sorted Arrays or Lists: Merge two sorted arrays or linked lists efficiently.
### 6. String Manipulation
Many string manipulation problems, such as checking for palindromes, finding sub-strings, or performing in-place replacements, can benefit from Two Pointers.

## 2 pointers algo problems
### 1. Two Sum Problem
Use two pointers to maintain left and right bounds. Move the pointers inward, adjusting based on the sum compared to the target.
### 2. Merge Sorted Arrays or Lists
Start from the end of the arrays or lists and merge elements in decreasing order.
### 3. Reverse a String or List
Use two pointers starting from the ends and swap elements until they meet in the middle.
### 4. Container With Most Water
Utilize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end. Calculate the area formed by these two pointers and move the pointer with the shorter height toward the center to search for a potentially larger area.
